Simple Chrome extension where the user pastes text that contains a url on Chrome and will take the user directly to the desired web page

## **WIP :**

- *Allow the input of multiple links by opening multiple tabs*

- *Create a better logic to detect full URLs*

- *Save collection of URL in a session that can be traced back*
